# Git-A-Pet: Project2!

For this project, we were tasked with creating a full stack application. Our group (4) included Nicole Apsche, Margaret Egner, and Solomon Lee, and we created an adoption platform using the PetFinder API. 


HIGHLIGHTED TECHNOLOGIES:

-We used Node and Express to create a Web Server to be easily accessible for users. Our easy-to-follow UI makes for a great user experience.
-We used Sequelize to access the MySQL Database, which houses the login information of the user, as well as previous searches conducted. 
-We used GET and POST routes to retrieve data from the API and display it to the user.
-We used new technologies including the PetFinder API, which gave us some experience using Auth Tokens as well, Passport JS to give the application login functionality. 
-We used dotenv to protect passowrds and API sensitive information.
-Our application is deployed to GitHub (https://napsche.github.io/Project2/) and Heroku (https://git-pet.herokuapp.com/).

Our motivation for this project was pretty simple: we have been in quarantine for five months now, and it can get pretty lonely. Many people are even working remotely permanently now in an effort to protect their health and wellbeing. What better way to combat the combination of loneliness and extra time than to also save a life? The shelters are filled with animals in need of a new best friend, so we used our project to give users the opportunity to find them!
